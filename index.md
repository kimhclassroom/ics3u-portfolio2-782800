# Hi, I'm Alina!
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- ### 🔧 Culminating Game: *(Milkyway Merge)*
- 🧠 About the game: Milkyway Merge is a simple drop puzzle game that requires you to combine planets to create bigger 
planets by dropping them into a box beside each other. The goal is to "evolve" these planets into 
bigger and bigger planets, up to a milkyway, to get the highest score. The bigger your planets by 
the time the box is filled, the higher your score.

## About me
I am a grade 11 student learning to code for the first time in Ms.Kim's ICS3U0R class. I enjoy probelm solving and learning news things, and I hope to do a lot of that in this class.
